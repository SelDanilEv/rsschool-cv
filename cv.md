3. At the moment I am studying programming at BSTU at the Faculty of IT for the 3rd year.
I am looking for a position as a front-end(js) developer now.
I see rs-school as a good way to get a lot of the necessary knowledge to develop myself as a front-end developer.
But in the future, I want to become full-stack(.NET,Node.js).
This is due to the fact that I want to be involved in the entire development process.
4. During my studies, I learned programming languages: **HTML/CSS/JS,C++,Node.js,.NET*(C#,Entity Framework,ADO.NET,WPF,WinForms,Xamarin Forms)*,Java*(SE,EE,Spring Framework)*,T-SQL**.
I also learned the basics of **assembler**.
Read the book **Head First JavaScript Programming** by Eric Freeman and Elizabeth Robson.
I have experience working with databases such as: **MySQL, MS SQL, SQL Azure, Oracle**.
I use and know the **git** commands.
There is a project using platform **Azure***(Remote database)*.
I got acquainted with design patterns*(MVC, MVVM, Builder, Abstract Factory,etc)* and methodologies*(Agile(Scrum,Kanban), EP, Spiral, Waterfall ,etc)* .
5. My projects: 
 - *[SDE-2019](https://github.com/SelDanilEv/CompilNew)* - my first course work on C++ translator from SDE-2019 language to assembler code.
